### X32 Soft Patch

None of the files are actually routed like this yet, a few files are of a similar one (the outputs are in a different order though)
- leon-test
- repatch
- karaoke
- panto '24 file (kinda)

Notes:
- If the patchbay is set up in a combined setup, then the Stereo Bus is the only thing that will have valid sends in the **Main Speaker System** / blue section of the diagram.
- Stereo bus simply refers to the main faders, grandmaster, etc, but is technically a bus as it can be routed to matrices
- Building Speaker bus goes to a 4-way RCA splitter that goes to
    - Backstage (this also includes Night Vision feed to backstage monitor)
    - Workshop speaker
    - FOH (for some reason only works in box office, and the cafe ones won't work, literally no idea why)
- FX Sends are technically a channel itself, but didn't really have a intuitive way to put it into the diagram as a channel (lmk if u think of one :))
